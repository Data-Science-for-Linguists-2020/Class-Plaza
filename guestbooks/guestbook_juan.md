## Juan's guestbook

Welcome to my guestbook. As of now I am mainly working on cleaning up the data and creating data frame objects from it. You can find a link to the repository and relevant directories/files below. All feedback is welcome. Thanks!

* Joey's Feedback
  * There's much to compliment here. Your introduction is informative, your code is overall well organized, and not only did you do a good job at cleaning up the data, I thought that defining methods for each step of the process that you can use for your other files was brilliant. Very well done.
  * One place in which I could foresee improvement is with the actual processing of the data. It seems that, other than removing the irrelevant rows, you're not doing much to add to the dataframe. Maybe you don't need to, so if you don't then disregard this, but it seem's like you could make the dataframe even more presentable, possibly by refining the POS column.
  * I made a similar comment in Jordan's guestbook, but your code helped me further understand the pickling process. Especially because the scale of your code will be so great once you've processed the other styles, I can see why making your data more persistent over multiple kernels and notebooks will be helpful.
