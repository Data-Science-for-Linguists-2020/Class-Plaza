### Lindsey's Feedback (3/2/2020)
- **What I liked**
    - Your README.md is formatted amazingly! Everything in it is so clear. I'll have to take some inspiration from it when I get around to poking at my README a bit more. Also liked the way you summarized at the end. I was sort of confused as to what exactly was going on in the notebook, but the summary made everything easy to understand. Finally, even though things didn't seem to go according to plan, it's nice to know what next steps you're going to take.
- **What could be improved**
    - I wasn't really sure as to what was going on after code cell 5 when things went awry. It just looked like big chunks of text, and the markdown cells in your progress notebook felt like they were a bit lacking. I'd find myself scrolling through large blocks of text and unknowingly skip over a markdown cell. I understand what you were trying to do by printing out those chunks of texts, but it wasn't too easy on the eyes.
- **What I learned**
    - The fact that Enron has had an issue to the degree of receiving its own dedicated Wikipedia header was news to me. I didn't really know what Enron was about in the first place, but clearly it was a big deal! I was especially shocked at the degree that their stock value dropped in 2000-2001. RIP Enron. Your project will be fun in the end because I'm also interested in the juicy stuff, after reading the Wiki.
- *Sean's Response*
    - Thanks so much for the response! A lot of people have brought up that first notebook, and it's a great point. I ended up pretty much redoing it with the second project report, so I might even just delete it.

### Natasha's Feedback (3/2/2020)
- **What I liked**: I love your project idea! You lay out the details of your plan and your data very clearly in your README file and even provide links to the specific situation of the Enron scandal.
- **What could be improved**: I think that flashing all of your data in the notebook file gets a bit confusing, and can make it easy to overlook aspects of your code. It might be more streamlined if you pick and choose what to show according to the result you want to emphasize.
- **What I learned**: I learned about what the Enron scandal was and also got some ideas about how I could format my own README.
- *Sean's Response*: Glad I could introduce some people to the Enron scandal! Incredibly fascinating to me. Thanks for the comments!

### Juan's Feedback (3/31/2020)
- **What I liked**: The goal of your project is super clear. Your `README.md` file is informative and easy to read. You've also done a good job documenting and explaining the steps that you have followed. The summaries that you include at the end of your notebooks are especially useful to understand your achievements and the challenges that remain. Overall, I think your procedure is well thought-out and informed by your data and goals.
- **What could be improved**: The first notebook was a bit harder to read because you flash very large amounts of data. I would consider flashing only an excerpt (using slashing for instance) for ease of reading.  A minor thing, but the links in your table of contents don't work. This is a problem I ran into as well. In my case it turned out to be an issue with the formatting of headers. You are using ids rather than headers so I'm not sure how to fix it.
- **What I learned**: This project is very informative as regards the handling and exploration of email data. I had never heard of the `email.parser` library, which seems to do a fairly good job.  
- *Sean's Response*: Thanks for the comment Juan! Definitely took the note about flashing, and I'm going to go back through all of my hyperlinks after the semester to make sure they're in good shape. They do require a bit of maintenance.

### Kiara's Feedback (4/2/2020)
- **What I liked**: I love how organized your notebooks are. You planned everything out and then started doing the project in a methodical way, and at times there's a lot of text displayed which can be hard to read, but it's really well thought out and you have a table of contents!! I'm sure you were really excited to have that. Didn't check to see if it worked though.
- **What could be improved**: You did the same thing Anthony did- you have a lot of material to read. Not to echo everyone else but maybe consider not flashing as much material.
- **What I learned**: Learned about email.parser which is really interesting. Also just learning about Enron in general was really interesting. Also love the read me so I might start playing around with formatting mine.

### Jordan's Feedback (4/14/2020)
- **What I liked**: Your data looks like it took a lot of work to wrangle into shape, good job! 
- **What could be improved**: You'll add it soon I'm sure, but I'm interested in seeing how your model will define a criminal message
- **What I learned**: Like others have said, the email.parser library looks like it would be very useful for some future project, I'm glad I was able to learn about it and gain a basic understanding of how it works from your project
