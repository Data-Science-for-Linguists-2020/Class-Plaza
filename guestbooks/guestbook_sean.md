### Lindsey's Feedback (3/2/2020)
- **What I liked**
    - Your README.md is formatted amazingly! Everything in it is so clear. I'll have to take some inspiration from it when I get around to poking at my README a bit more. Also liked the way you summarized at the end. I was sort of confused as to what exactly was going on in the notebook, but the summary made everything easy to understand. Finally, even though things didn't seem to go according to plan, it's nice to know what next steps you're going to take.
- **What could be improved**
    - I wasn't really sure as to what was going on after code cell 5 when things went awry. It just looked like big chunks of text, and the markdown cells in your progress notebook felt like they were a bit lacking. I'd find myself scrolling through large blocks of text and unknowingly skip over a markdown cell. I understand what you were trying to do by printing out those chunks of texts, but it wasn't too easy on the eyes.
- **What I learned**
    - The fact that Enron has had an issue to the degree of receiving its own dedicated Wikipedia header was news to me. I didn't really know what Enron was about in the first place, but clearly it was a big deal! I was especially shocked at the degree that their stock value dropped in 2000-2001. RIP Enron. Your project will be fun in the end because I'm also interested in the juicy stuff, after reading the Wiki.

- **What I liked**: I love your project idea! You lay out the details of your plan and your data very clearly in your README file and even provide links to the specific situation of the Enron scandal.
- **What could be improved**: I think that flashing all of your data in the notebook file gets a bit confusing, and can make it easy to overlook aspects of your code. It might be more streamlined if you pick and choose what to show according to the result you want to emphasize.
- **What I learned**: I learned about what the Enron scandal was and also got some ideas about how I could format my own README.

### Juan's Feedback (3/31/2020)
- **What I liked**: The goal of your project is super clear. Your `README.md` file is informative and easy to read. You've also done a good job documenting and explaining the steps that you have followed. The summaries that you include at the end of your notebooks are especially useful to understand your achievements and the challenges that remain. Overall, I think your procedure is well thought-out and informed by your data and goals.
- **What could be improved**: The first notebook was a bit harder to read because you flash very large amounts of data. I would consider flashing only an excerpt (using slashing for instance) for ease of reading.  A minor thing, but the links in your table of contents don't work. This is a problem I ran into as well. In my case it turned out to be an issue with the formatting of headers. You are using ids rather than headers so I'm not sure how to fix it.
- **What I learned**: This project is very informative as regards the handling and exploration of email data. I had never heard of the `email.parser` library, which seems to do a fairly good job.
