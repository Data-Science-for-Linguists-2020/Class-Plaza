## Analysis of Japanese Loanwords: Lindsey's Guestbook
Welcome to my Guestbook! As of now, I'm working on cleaning conversation data, hopefully to isolate each speaker's utterances from the .txt files. Any advice or critique is appreciated!

- **What is done well:** I think this project is super interesting! I don't know any Japanese but I understand the idea. You provide details about data acquisition and you thought about what bigger questions you could ask now that you have the data. Nice treatment of the NaN values. I think your notebook is also easy to read.
- **What could be improved:** How are you going to operationalize the sociolinguistic variables? That could have implications for the way you organize and manipulate the data as you move forward. We worked with Google n-gram data in Computational Linguistics so that's a good place to start if you do decide to work with n-grams later on. As a last note, why did you choose the frequency you did? You might need to normalize it for statistical analyses.
- **What I learned:** I learned what Katakana is and more about Japanese in general. Coding-wise, I learned more about handling null values.
