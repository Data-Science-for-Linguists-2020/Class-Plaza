## Analysis of Japanese Loanwords: Lindsey's Guestbook
Welcome to my Guestbook! As of now, I'm working on cleaning conversation data, hopefully to isolate each speaker's utterances from the .txt files. Any advice or critique is appreciated!

### Comments

#### Juan

- **What is done well:** I think this project is super interesting! I don't know any Japanese but I understand the idea. You provide details about data acquisition and you thought about what bigger questions you could ask now that you have the data. Nice treatment of the NaN values. I think your notebook is also easy to read.
- **What could be improved:** How are you going to operationalize the sociolinguistic variables? That could have implications for the way you organize and manipulate the data as you move forward. We worked with Google n-gram data in Computational Linguistics so that's a good place to start if you do decide to work with n-grams later on. As a last note, why did you choose the frequency you did? You might need to normalize it for statistical analyses.
- **What I learned:** I learned what Katakana is and more about Japanese in general. Coding-wise, I learned more about handling null values.

### Kiara
- **What I liked**
    - I don't really know what's happening in your project because I don't know Japanese, but your whole project is organized really well and the explanations were really good, so it was easier to understand.
- **Possible improvements**
    - Since I really don't know much about Japanese or how it works, I'm afraid I can't offer much in way of improvements at this stage. Looking at Juan said, I agree with what he said, but I'd be lying if I said I came up with it myself.
- **What I learned**
    - I learned about Japanese! I had no idea what Katakana was, so that was really interesting to me. You also handled your data and null values using things I hadn't used before, so it was cool to see that being implemented. I also learned a lot from your data-cleaning process. Although our two processes will invariably differ exponentially, it was interesting to see how you did it.
