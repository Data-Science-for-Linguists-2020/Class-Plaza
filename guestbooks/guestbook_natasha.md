### Lindsey's Feedback (3/2/2020)
- **What I liked**
    - This project topic is incredibly interesting to me. Testing to see if social media (Twitter specifically) is growing more negative for one reason or another is not only doable but intriguing to the degree that I want to check this out a bit myself. I feel like Twitter has indeed gotten more negative over time because of the political climate, etc. But maybe your project will prove me wrong!
- **What could be improved**
    - README.md could be a little more detailed. It just seems lacking compared to some of the other projects' READMEs. Unfortunately, there also isn't very much in your repo right now for me to even comment on at the time of writing this (Monday evening, around 9:30pm), so there isn't much else to say. 
- **What I learned**
    - See above; since there's not much in your repo, there's not much I can say here. You did mention in your project plan that there might be a thing in NLTK for Twitter processing. After double checking with a Google search, I did learn that there is something in NLTK that processes Twitter data.
