# Guestbook for [Arabic Learner Corpus Considerations](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Arabic-Learner-Corpus-Considerations)
**Anthony Verardi | Spring 2020 | University of Pittsburgh**

Welcome to my project! I'm investigating the [Arabic Learner Corpus](https://www.arabiclearnercorpus.com/)
to see what kinds of questions it might be useful for answering. My main idea right now is to play around
with the data and let insights emerge from there instead of trying to explore one question in particular.
Currently, I'm working on loading my data into a usable format. Feel free to sign the guestbook below and
leave some feedback!

## Feedback

### Natasha's Feedback (3/2/2020)
- **What I liked**: Honesty your thoroughness and explanation of the material is what I strive for in this class. You really explain your project and data in great detail so even someone who might have no context for the project can understand it well. 
- **What could be improved**: There are some points where a lot of text is flashed on your notebook which might be jarring and take away from the relevant data that you are looking at. Maybe clipping how much you show can get your point across without distracting from the real data you want to show.
- **What I learned**: I started to see what the process might be for working with non-Roman characters in python and i'm excited to see more of how that works! I also learned some interesting things about the Arabic language and how the data includes native speakers of a different dialect of Arabic. 

### Sean's Feedback (3/3/2020)
- **What I liked**: You can definitely tell you put the time in. Very well organized, great methodology, and important linguistic variation consideration. I really enjoy the style your NB's are in, keep it up!
- **What could be improved**: I would say there is one or two cells with a *lot* of text, so maybe don't flash in those cases. Other than that things look great! I also wanted to mention that I think Stanford's POS tagger/NLPcore would be perfect for your project, as it's widely cited in academia and handles Arabic (what kind of Arabic, I do not know). Here's the link: https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.html
- **What I learned**: I learned a lot about how difficult it is to do work with XML files, and also how difficult research in a macro-language can be. Best of luck, hope Beautiful Soup works for you!
