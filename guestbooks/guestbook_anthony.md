# Guestbook for [Arabic Learner Corpus Considerations](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Arabic-Learner-Corpus-Considerations)
## Anthony Verardi | Spring 2020 | University of Pittsburgh

Welcome to my project! I'm investigating the [Arabic Learner Corpus](https://www.arabiclearnercorpus.com/)
to see what kinds of questions it might be useful for answering. My main idea right now is to play around
with the data and let insights emerge from there instead of trying to explore one question in particular.
Currently, I'm working on loading my data into a usable format. Feel free to sign the guestbook below and
leave some feedback!
