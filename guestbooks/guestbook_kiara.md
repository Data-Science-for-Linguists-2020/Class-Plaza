## Star Wars Dialogue Analysis - Kiara
Welcome!! I was having a lot of issues with reading all the data in as a group, so for the deadline I switched to reading in files individually. I was following a tutorial, so once I'm done doing all of my work for Soudi and Karen, I plan on focusing on this project. I literally don't have anything in depth in the GitHub repo, so I apologize for that . The most detailed stuff is what I've done with the code so far, but even the final version of that never really got uploaded by the deadline. I have it, I just hadn't pushed it.

- **What is done well:** This is an interesting project! Looking forward to the developments. So far I think the procurement of the data is well done.
- **What could be improved:** What variables are you planning to explore? That is to say, how are you going to operationalize "differences in speech" or "changes in speech"? The code for all notebooks reads "Episode IV" even though it's different episodes. To get all the data frames in the same notebook you might consider pickling them.
- **What I learned:** I learned about some useful tools (webdriver, BeautifulSoup) to extract raw text from websites.
