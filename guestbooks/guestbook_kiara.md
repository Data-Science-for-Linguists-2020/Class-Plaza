- **What is done well:** This is an interesting project! Looking forward to the developments. So far I think the procurement of the data is well done.
- **What could be improved:** What variables are you planning to explore? That is to say, how are you going to operationalize "differences in speech" or "changes in speech"? The code for all notebooks reads "Episode IV" even though it's different episodes. To get all the data frames in the same notebook you might consider pickling them.
- **What I learned:** I learned about some useful tools (webdriver, BeautifulSoup) to extract raw text from websites.
