This file contains peer feedback to my term project, Sentiment Analysis of Trump Tweets. The repository for my project can be found [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Trump-Tweets).

* Anthony's Feedback
	* You've done a great job structuring your code notebook so far, and I can see how it will probably develop as you continue to work on it.
	Very organized, very readable. Also props for storing your emoji information in a separate script and reading it in, that's a great way
	to keep your analysis file from getting cluttered.
	* I think you might want to spend more time explaining what Textblob is, how it works, and any potential shortcomings that you/your reader
	should be aware of. Also, when looking for specific elements in the string, you might actually want to include all-caps speech! Trump's
	certainly no stranger to it, and I think you'd miss out on "WITCH HUNT" with your current setup if you tried to find it. 
	* It's been cooling learning about Textblob, even though I definitely have more questions than answers! I'm looking forward to seeing this
	project develop.
