* Anthony's Feedback
	* Good call defining your own functions! If you're going to keep working in the same notebook file and doing the same kinds of processing multiple times,
	it makes a lot of sense.
	* Try to improve the level of detail that you're putting into your comments and use of markdown lines. I was struggling a little
	to get a sense of what your thought process was as you worked on curating your data, and some additional explanation would be beneficial
	for giving readers a sense of your work.
	* I've learned a good deal more about using lambda to process data from looking through your notebook! I'm going to be working with a lot of metadata as well,
	so I'm sure it'll come in handy.
