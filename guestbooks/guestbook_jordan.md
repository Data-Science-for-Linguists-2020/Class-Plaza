* Anthony's Feedback
	* Good call defining your own functions! If you're going to keep working in the same notebook file and doing the same kinds of processing multiple times,
	it makes a lot of sense.
	* Try to improve the level of detail that you're putting into your comments and use of markdown lines. I was struggling a little
	to get a sense of what your thought process was as you worked on curating your data, and some additional explanation would be beneficial
	for giving readers a sense of your work.
	* I've learned a good deal more about using lambda to process data from looking through your notebook! I'm going to be working with a lot of metadata as well,
	so I'm sure it'll come in handy.
	
* Joey's Feedback
	* You do a good job of making sense of all the data. Specifically, it seems like your data file is rather complex, so merging it all and adding the relevant pieces is going to help you in the long run.
	* One thing that I think could be better is the organization of your code. You can do this by using markdown cells and making your comments more descriptive. Splitting your code into smaller cells will also help with readability.
	* Pickle is something that I was not familiar with, but after a little research is seems like you're using it to help with the persistence of the most important data. I'd be interested to find out more about what pickle is and why you're using it.
