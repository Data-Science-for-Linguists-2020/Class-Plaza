* Anthony's Feedback
	* Good call defining your own functions! If you're going to keep working in the same notebook file and doing the same kinds of processing multiple times,
	it makes a lot of sense.
	* Try to improve the level of detail that you're putting into your comments and use of markdown lines. I was struggling a little
	to get a sense of what your thought process was as you worked on curating your data, and some additional explanation would be beneficial
	for giving readers a sense of your work.
	* I've learned a good deal more about using lambda to process data from looking through your notebook! I'm going to be working with a lot of metadata as well,
	so I'm sure it'll come in handy.

* Joey's Feedback
	* You do a good job of making sense of all the data. Specifically, it seems like your data file is rather complex, so merging it all and adding the relevant pieces is going to help you in the long run.
	* One thing that I think could be better is the organization of your code. You can do this by using markdown cells and making your comments more descriptive. Splitting your code into smaller cells will also help with readability.
	* Pickle is something that I was not familiar with, but after a little research is seems like you're using it to help with the persistence of the most important data. I'd be interested to find out more about what pickle is and why you're using it.

* Sean's Feedback
	* Great use of functions early on, saves a ton of work later on. Also, great topic choice: it's a clear and specific goal. Further, you selected a great data source to pursue it.
	* I would look into using Juypter's different functionalities a bit. Even just an hour or so makes the notebook look so much cleaner. There were a few spaces where the lines were messy as well as the headers.
	* Your use of GREP was great! I'll definitely need to reference that in the future.

	* Hi Sean, thanks for the feedback. I had some issues with my repo so the report you looked at is actually my first project report, I uploaded the second update a couple hours later.

* Natasha's Feedback (4/2)
	* I liked seeing your data processing being a separate notebook from the analysis based code because I think that is something that made my own code look messy. It's great to see a graph as a visual for the numbers. I'm really interested to see the results you get!
	* I think the format and explanations in the notebook could be a little clearer. It's a bit hard to follow what each portion of code is doing, so an explanation afterwards might help the reader.
	* I'm going to use your idea for separating tasks out on different notebooks instead of having all of progress 2 in one place. I think it will save processing power.

* Juan's Feedback (4/15)
	* I'm interested in the acquisition of morphosyntax so it's always nice to read projects like this. Yours is an interesting idea and it's informed by your own experience. Good job defining all the functions that you can reuse later and save space!
	* I would consider adding some pseudocode as markdown cells to explain what you are doing; at least for the major steps. The visualizations are helpful. I would recommend adding a title and/or legend to them so that they are understandable outside of the notebook.
	* Interesting use of a tree bank! The use of `lambda` was highly informative as well.

* Kiara's Feedback (4/15)
	* I love the use of functions. It'll save time in the future and putting it in a separate notebook everything looking cleaner and more organized.
	* I was really interested in your project but it was kind of hard to follow along with. I didn't really understand everything that was happening, so maybe an explanation or just a reminder of what's happening would be appreciated!
	* I liked your use of lambda. I'm actually so impressed with the number of times you used it that I'm going to make an effort to understand it and use it more.

* Lindsey's Feedback
	* Your use of functions is impressive. Good on you for recognizing when a task can be repetitive and planning how you can tackle that issue. Cleaning data can be a daunting task, especially since yours seems pretty complex, so it's good to make the task both computationally and human-ly (if that makes sense?) efficient. 
	* Re: many others' criticisms - I find it the easiest to follow along with a project that documents the steps you're taking, or even just reminds the reader of where you're going. Markdown cells are available in those notebooks -- use them! 
	* Also re: others' learnings - the lambda function is not something I really understand at all. Looking at your code helped me understand where and when it can be used!
