# Todo 9: Past Project Critiques 
## Lindsey
- Project 1: ESL Article Acquisition 
	- **What I liked:** The project was very well-organized and pretty easy to understand, for the most part. The graphs were readable, clear, and colorful. I also took a peek at the first progress report notebook, and the code was simplistic, which is a good thing in my opinion; I have a habit of taking an overcomplicated approach to some projects, so the fact that this student used more simplistic code to filter the data and produce fascinating results gives me hope that this might be a bit easier than I first thought. 
	- **What could be improved:** I feel like it would have helped the project a bit to include more than just the three languages; I feel like there could be some other important parts of article acquisition not just based on whether a language has articles or not, but also what sort of mix of articles a certain L1 has and how that speaker's L1 is apparent in their use of English. 
	- **What I learned:** I learned both that a "zero article" exists. I thought there was just an absence of articles in some cases, rather than having a specific term for the absence of an article. Kinda reminds me of the empty set, for anyone familiar with set theory. 
- Project 2: Reddit Comment Analysis
	- **What I liked**: Both machine learning and data from social media are super interesting to me, so I was excited to see a project that combined the two. I like how diverse the subreddits chosen for the projects were; I saw r/politics and figured it'd be a very interesting project. I was also impressed with the data cleaning, considering the size of the corpus used. 
	- **What could be improved:** I wasn't entirely sure what was being analyzed here; I looked at the project plan, and "linguistic trends" seems a bit vague. I also wasn't really able to figure out what these trends were, but maybe that's because I'm not familiar with the types of graphs that were used. Also, I frequently use Reddit, but not everyone does, so I feel like including a glossary of some sort would have been helpful in the end. 
	- **What I learned:** I learned that lzma is a thing that exists that's super helpful for working with compressed files, which really helps with large datasets. I don't intend on using a dataset nearly as large as this for my project in this class, but it could be useful if/when I work with other larger datasets in the future.
