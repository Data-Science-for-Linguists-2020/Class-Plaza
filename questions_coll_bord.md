# Questions for guest speakers

Jordan: Are licenses something that you need a lawyer for? Is there a default system for data/code protection built into github?
*Lauren: You definitely do not need a lawyer! We'll talk about creative commons licenses, GNU licenses, MIT licenses in the presentation. Any person can choose to apply these to material that they own copyright for.* 

Sean: What is the role of personal privacy in licensing and protecting your project data?
      If we're taking data from someone who republished the data publicly, do we need to contact the republisher? The original publisher? What if we can't?
      Are there types of projects for which you wouldn't need to respect licenses? (I'm thinking of how IRB's often aren't required for findings that aren't "for generalizable knowledge".)
*Lauren: A lot of this depends on licensing, which we'll cover in class, but there's plenty of room to learn a lot about this topic! You should always look for and respect licenses, because they operate under contract law. There is a provision of copyright law in the US called Fair Use, which we'll cover briefly. (This is called Fair Dealing in other countries.) This allows for some re-use without permission for certain uses. More to come!*

Joey: It seems like even if you collect data yourself, there can still be a reasonable argument as to why it is not yours (i.e., tweets aren't yours, webpages aren't yours, etc.). At what point are we allowed to claim our data as our own property?  
*Lauren: Great question! You can claim data that you created yourself, or that you collected when the data are not subject to copyright. We'll talk about some things that aren't subject to copyright in class - you can claim your work to organize public domain information into a database, for example.*
  
Lindsey: What's the usage policy on code available on places like Stack Overflow or Reddit (for example, a Python script that filters out certain words from a corpus)? Are they fair game since they're public? How should we cite them?; 
How should we approach data published in other countries/languages? Are there any special precautions we should take like doing research on data policies in those countries, or should we just translate the license (if necessary) and use it at that surface level?
*Lauren: Public does not necessarily mean reusable. Check Terms of Service and look for a license, and if it's unclear, assume the material is under copyright and conduct a Fair Use analysis. We'll talk about this in class a bit. And licenses can operate across languages! For example, Creative Commons licenses have been translated into many languages.* 


Natasha: Is simply creating a text file saying "do not steal" sufficient as a license? Are there levels of licensing protection, and if so what are they and when is it appropriate to use them?
*Lauren: You could do this, but it doesn't legally help you or potential re-users! I have lots of funny stories about this from fanfiction, but that's not part of this class. There are lots of easy and helpful tools out there to apply licenses for your work that help people reuse you work, and if you don't want anybody to reuse your work, you can just assert copyright (or not put any license on it). Check out http://choosealicense.com which is my favorite tool; we'll talk about this more in class too.*

Juan: What license do you recommend for projects such as ours (e.g., code for analyzing linguistic data)? If we are using a licensed data set, what are some best practices in terms of transparency and open science? I know that we cannot publish the whole data set, but can we post a sample (with due attribution)? If so, how big can the sample be?  
*Lauren: We'll cover some helpful tools like choosealicense.com in class. For things you want to share just part of, a Fair Use analysis will be your friend. We'll cover this briefly, and if you have questions, come see us in Hillman Library.*

Kiara: Are the repercussions for using data and ignoring the license and using data for something other than the license allows different? Also, is there a limit to how far a prosecuter can go depending on how the license is violated? For example, if someone completely ignored a license or if the license allowed for academic use but then someone continued to use the data for something other than academics? I also think it would depend on who the licenser is, like Disney and a college student would probably pursue violations differently, and if for some reason they both violated licensing, I feel like the repercussions would be different for both as well.
*Lauren: A license is a contract and can be a legally binding document. You can get something like a DMCA Takedown Notice, which just requires you to take down the material; this can also be sent to your service provider who might take down your whole website without notice. Legally, a college student owner and Disney as an owner have the same rights, but they may behave differently (this usually comes down to money). There are many allowances for reuse under Fair Use, which we will cover in class. Best to ask an expert and educate yourself if you're going to be doing this! Check out some of our Copyright Workshops in the library to get started.* 

Anthony: Thank you both for joining us today! My question is about ethics and data,
		but beyond the scope of what is *legally permissible* under the auspices 
		of copyright law and what is *ethically* or maybe *morally* sound. 
		So specifically, I'm wondering about whether it's really ethical for us,
		as researchers, to be using people's data from Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, etc.
		(publicly scrapable sources) for purposes that may result in profit for us
		(either directly through compensation for our work or indirectly through hiring on
		the grounds of the *merit* of our work) without then somehow compensating the
		people we're getting our data from. I know this is a mouthful and there probably
		isn't an answer but it seems important to think about. I know that
		participants aren't always compensated for their participation in a study, but
		it seems a little morally ambiguous to me to be taking people's data without
		their express consent and using it for personal gain, even if credit is given.
*Lauren: This is a great question. Ethically and morally, using public data is a really important topic. There are some legal ways to reuse data that may not be ethical. Prime example, the Aarhus OKCupid story: https://www.vox.com/2016/5/12/11666116/70000-okcupid-users-data-release*
